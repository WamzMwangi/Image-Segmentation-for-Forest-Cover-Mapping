## Semantic Image Segmentation for Forest Cover Mapping

  Accurate information on forest cover is important for supporting forest conservation and management efforts. Traditional methods of determining forest cover such as ground-based surveys are very tedious, expensive and time consuming. 
  Advanced methods, such as remote sensing coupled with robust geographical information systems (GIS) present an opportunity for cost effective and large scale forest cover mapping. However they still rely on very simple classification algorithms and require experts to manually draw polygons over the various classes (Gachuhi & Kibui, 2024). Other advanced approaches to forest mapping involve using indices derived from satellite imagery such as the Normalised Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), but this too is prone to inaccuracies because it is easily affected by conditions such as soil moisture and NDVI cannot differentiate between very similar classes such as  a shrub and a forest (Cropin, 2021).
  To counter these limitations, deep learning techniques can be used to automate the process of identifying forested areas from satellite images. One such technique is semantic segmentation which is a computer vision task that classifies each pixel in an input image into specific classes resulting in a dense pixel-wise feature map.
This project will evaluate the performance of two semantic segmentation models in identifying forest cover from satellite images
